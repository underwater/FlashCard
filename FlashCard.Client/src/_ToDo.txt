Is it better to navigate another component or display modal dialog for this type of thing ?

tempale form save / cancel questions
- save ins't working

template form add new
Are you sure ? (before Card delete)

validation (green / red with messages)
- prevent nav away if not saved / cancelled
- routing guard / anyway to prevent window from closing ?


How to do it with reactive form?

- if example trying to delete something I shouldn't

which forms controls
- bootstrap, ng-bootstrap, or
- materials / schemas ?

Icons for buttons etc
- Font awesome?
